<h2>
About this project
</h2>

The CustomCursor project introduces an enhanced cursor experience within a webpage. This project adds a secondary cursor that follows the primary cursor with a delay of 0.6 seconds, although this delay can be adjusted to 0 seconds if desired. When the primary cursor moves, the secondary cursor trails behind, creating a visually engaging effect.

Additionally, as the primary cursor moves over an image, the secondary cursor expands to four times its original size. This enlarged cursor can display text within it, offering a unique and interactive way to highlight or annotate images. This feature not only enhances the visual appeal but also improves the user experience by providing dynamic and context-sensitive interactions.
